A blogging software that is currently in (limited) beta testing. To setup, you must place these files in whichever directory you please, and run the command:

```sh
./blogsetup
```
It currently lacks the promised plugin API and post Archiving feature. Everything else up-n-running however.

This will run the setup program, creating everything required to begin blogging!

Until I can get a method of hashing the user passwords working, the credentials for the admin panel are:
Username: DemoUser, Password: Password
