A blogging software that is currently in (limited) beta testing. To setup, you must place these files in whichever directory you please, and create the directories "categories", "uploads", "posts" and "xml-posts". 

After that simply run the command:
```sh
./blogsetup
```
It currently lacks the promised plugin API and post Archiving feature. Everything else up-n-running however.
